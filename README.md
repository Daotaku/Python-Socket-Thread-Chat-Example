# Python-Socket-Thread-Chat-Example
An example of using python socket and threading to create a command prompt chat

This is a basic example of using python to create a chat based command prompt.

The idea came from watching on youtube about Python Socket Programming Tutorial and from there I was thinking on expanding it into a server chat.

This version doesn't use database and the chat were saved inside as a list, so closing or restarting would erase the chat. Also you would need to set the IP address on the client.py file to point at the server IP address (the IP address on this file is my local file).

Have fun.
